- use https://github.com/wstephenson/klyde/tree/master/startup/kde-session-units as inspiration
- don't make use of start_kdeinit_wrapper which is just a hack. See also:
  https://projects.kde.org/projects/frameworks/kinit/repository/revisions/master/entry/src/start_kdeinit/start_kdeinit_wrapper.c#L31
- dbus-1.6.8 provides an incompatible xinitrc.d/80-dbus file which sets the wrong DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable
- make sure ksmserver takes control of the session using TakeControl(). See also:

- `kcmshell5 formats` creates `~/.config/plasma-locale-settings.sh` which is meant to be run by startkde... proper solution needed
